      <p>My girlfriend wrote this introduction to Canvas. Enjoy.</p>

      <p>Canvas is one of the fun things in life. To wrap canvas around some
      wood, you first need some good pine. Once you have a good frame work you
      can start breeding your snake. To breed a snake suitable for gaming with
      you need to start with some green fimo and some pva glue. Once you have
      made a suitable snake you should then make another one with different
      characteristics, to breed them together and make a Super Snake. Your new
      Super Snake will be the ultimate gaming snake, perfect for following
      instructions and making the game really fun. If you should happen to mix
      in some red fimo your snake will have extra fire and the game will go
      extra fast, and therefore it will be even funner. So, now you've got your
      framework and Super Snake you're now ready to create a course for it to
      shimmy around. The course should always be made from chopsticks, old
      brussel sprouts and a bit of gin. The type of gin doesn't matter but
      always use Japanese chopsticks, otherwise your course won't flow
      well.</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="action">A fixed-size HTML element</li>
        <li class="action">Defines an area of the page that can be drawn on</li>
        <li class="action">Can be transparent (used as an overlay)</li>

        <h1>Getting the context</h1>
      </hgroup>

      <p>The canvas isn't used directly - you draw on an object called its
      <code>context</code>.</p>

      <p>The context is obtained by calling <code>getContext('2d')</code> on
      the canvas element. (There may be a 3d canvas element in the future, but
      for now all we have is 2d).</p>

        <h1>Making a game loop</h1>
      </hgroup>

      <p>The game loop is a function that is called at a set interval, and updates the game.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Update the game state</li>
        <li>Update the display to reflect the new state</li>
      </ul>

        <h1>Drawing a snake</h1>
        <h2>Part 1</h2>
      </hgroup>

      <p>The snake is drawn as a collection of squares. It's represented as an
      array of co-ordinates, with the head at the beginning.</p>

      <p>Each frame adds a new position to the front of the snake and removes
      the last one.</p>

      <p>Each time round the game loop:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>snake.advance()</code> is called to move the snake</li>
        <li><code>snake.draw()</code> is called to draw the snake on the canvas.</li>
        <li><code>draw()</code> calls <code>drawSection</code> which draws each square</li>
      </ul>

      <hgroup>
        <h1>Drawing a snake</h1>
        <h2>Part 2</h2>
      </hgroup>

      <p>Calling <code>context.save()</code> and <code>context.restore()</code>
      saves and restores the canvas settings, including fillStyle.</p>

        <h1>Adding an apple</h1>
      </hgroup>

      <p>The apple is drawn as a circle. To create a circle in canvas, call on the context:
      <ul>
        <li><code>beginPath()</code></li>
        <li><code>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, antiClockwise?)</code></li>
        <li><code>fill()</code></li>
      </ul>
